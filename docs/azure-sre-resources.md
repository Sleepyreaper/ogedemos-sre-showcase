## Post-GA blog posts worth incorporating

These are patterns Microsoft has published that we could add as future demos in this showcase:

| Blog post | Idea for this showcase |
|---|---|
| [Event-Driven IaC Operations: Terraform Drift Detection via HTTP Triggers](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/blog/appsonazureblog/event-driven-iac-operations-with-azure-sre-agent-terraform-drift-detection-via-h/4512233) | Add a 5th scenario: a Terraform drift detector that triggers `ogeagenticops` when a `terraform plan` diff appears |

| [Log Analytics + App Insights MCP-backed Connectors](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/blog/appsonazureblog/new-in-azure-sre-agent-log-analytics-and-application-insights-connectors/4509649) | Wire the `dteops-log` LAW + `dteops-appi` to `ogeagenticops` so it can correlate DTE app failures with Azure infrastructure events |

## Key product capabilities (reference)

From https://sre.azure.com/docs/overview, four outcome categories:

1. **Autonomous Incident Response** — alerts → context + RCA + mitigation suggest/execute
2. **Lightning-fast Root Cause Analysis** — multi-signal correlation across logs, metrics, traces, deployments
3. **Extensible Automation with Built-in and MCP Connectors** — Teams, Outlook, PagerDuty, ServiceNow built-in; everything else via MCP
4. **Persistent Knowledge** — every investigation captured, learns team patterns, ramps new on-call

Built-in connectors today: Azure Monitor, Log Analytics, Application Insights, Microsoft Teams, Outlook, Azure Resource Graph, GitHub OAuth, PagerDuty, ServiceNow.

Built-in subagent tools today:
- `SearchMemory` — query the knowledge base
- `RunAzCliReadCommands` / `RunAzCliWriteCommands` / `GetAzCliHelp`
- `QueryLogAnalyticsByWorkspaceId` — KQL against a LAW
- `QueryAppInsightsByResourceId` — KQL against App Insights
- `ExecutePythonCode` — code interpreter for charts, calculations, file processing

## Pricing model

Per the [active flow billing blog](https://aka.ms/sreagent/pricing/blog):
- **Always-on**: 4 AAUs per agent-hour (unchanged)
- **Active flows**: token-based (was time-based), per-model-provider AAU rates
- See https://aka.ms/sreagent/pricing for current rates

This is relevant for budgeting demos at scale — the showcase scenarios consume minimal AAUs because the agent only runs during investigations, not continuously.

## Patterns we're NOT yet using (next-iteration ideas)

- **Response Plans** — automated routing from incident filter → subagent. Today the user has to invoke a subagent via `/agent` in chat. With response plans, an Azure Monitor alert on `ogedemo-storm-vmss` could automatically invoke `reliability-fixer` without human typing.
- **MCP servers** — extend with Slack, Jira, Datadog, or a custom DTE MCP server that exposes SCADA/AMI telemetry.
- **Scheduled tasks** — "daily morning briefing on OGEDemos_RG" matches the DTE Cloud Weather Ops pattern.
- **Defender for Cloud integration** — pull security recommendations directly into `security-fixer`'s context.
- **Lighthouse multi-tenant** — let one `ogeagenticops` instance manage both OGEDemos_RG and a customer-side RG.
