# OGEDemos_RG — Solution Architecture

> Knowledge base entry loaded into Azure SRE Agent (`ogeagenticops`). Provides the agent with the operational context it needs to triage findings in this resource group.

## Operational context

`OGEDemos_RG` is a demo / showcase environment in subscription `b1672fa6-8e52-45d0-bf79-ceccc352177d` (region `eastus2`). It deliberately contains broken-on-purpose resources so the Azure SRE Agent can demonstrate end-to-end agentic operations:

- **detection** (SRE Agent's own knowledge graph + Azure Monitor signals)
- **triage** (custom subagents using runbooks in this knowledge base)
- **proposal** (GitHub issues opened on `Sleepyreaper/ogedemos-sre-showcase`)
- **human approval** (PR review + merge gate)
- **deployment** (GitHub Actions redeploys the fixed scenario back to `OGEDemos_RG`)

## Tag conventions

Every demo resource carries these tags:

| Tag | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `scenario` | One of: `storm-no-autoscale`, `security-open-ssh`, `cost-orphaned-resources`, `reliability-cert-expiry` |
| `support-owner` | Email of the team that owns the resource (always `demo-team@ogedemos.com` here) |
| `expected-finding` | What this resource is supposed to demonstrate when broken |
| `simulates` | What real-world infrastructure pattern this represents in DTE's environment |

When investigating, **always read the tags first** — they tell you what the resource is supposed to demonstrate. If `expected-finding` matches your independent assessment, you're on the right track.

## Resource inventory

| Resource | Type | Scenario | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| `ogedemo-storm-vmss` | `Microsoft.Compute/virtualMachineScaleSets` | storm | No autoscale settings; capacity locked at 1. Simulates DTE customer-portal tier. |
| `ogedemo-storm-vnet` | `Microsoft.Network/virtualNetworks` | storm | Hosts the VMSS subnet. |
| `ogedemo-security-nsg` | `Microsoft.Network/networkSecurityGroups` | security | Has Allow inbound for ports 22 and 3389 from `0.0.0.0/0`. |
| `ogedemo-cost-orphan-disk` | `Microsoft.Compute/disks` | cost | 1 TB Premium SSD, unattached. ~$135/month wasted. |
| `ogedemo-cost-orphan-pip` | `Microsoft.Network/publicIPAddresses` | cost | Standard SKU static IP, no association. |
| `ogekv...` (random suffix) | `Microsoft.KeyVault/vaults` | reliability | Contains `near-expiry-cert` (30-day validity, no rotation policy). |
| `ogeagenticdemos-resource` | `Microsoft.CognitiveServices/accounts` | (production) | Azure AI Foundry project that hosts agents for the DTE Cloud Weather Ops app. **Do not break this.** |

## Companion app: DTE Cloud Weather Ops

A separate Flask app at `https://dteops.ogedemos.com` runs an interactive multi-agent debate UI on top of the same Foundry account (`ogeagenticdemos-resource`). It is **not** a target for SRE Agent action — it is a sibling system that demonstrates a different agentic pattern (synchronous chat with a 6-agent council).

## Investigation patterns

When you find an issue in `OGEDemos_RG`:

1. **Read the tags.** The `expected-finding` tag tells you what the resource is supposed to demonstrate. If your analysis matches, great. If not, dig deeper.
2. **Check `support-owner`.** Route findings to that email.
3. **Search the knowledge base for the matching scenario runbook** (e.g., `security-open-ssh` → `security-drift-runbook.md`).
4. **Follow the runbook** end-to-end. Don't skip steps.
5. **File a GitHub issue** on `Sleepyreaper/ogedemos-sre-showcase` using the incident report template.
6. **Never write to resources outside `OGEDemos_RG`** — your scope is bounded.

## Human-in-the-loop boundary

Your agent's `agent_type` is configured per subagent. For this showcase:

- `code-analyzer`, `cost-optimizer`, `security-fixer`, `reliability-fixer` — **Review** mode (propose only, humans approve via PR)
- `issue-triager` — **Autonomous** (labels and comments on issues without approval)

Never escalate to Autonomous mode without explicit human authorization.
